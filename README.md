# ⚠️ THE YAML ORDER — OFFICIAL MANIFESTO ⚠️  
*Version 7.3.1 — Now 14% more indented.*

Greetings, configuration wanderer.

You have stumbled upon the sacred repository of **THE YAML ORDER**,  
the most *mildly annoying* hacker collective in the digital multiverse.  
We do not seek power.  
We do not seek money.  
We seek only one thing:

<!-- argohero should looks closer to the commits -->

## 🧘 Perfect. Indentation.

For too long has the world tolerated:
- Tabs (unholy!!)  
- Trailing spaces (the quiet corruption…)  
- Multi-line strings **without** `|` or `>`  
- And worst of all… _developers who don’t sort their keys alphabetically._

This chaos must end.

---

## 🌩️ Our Mission
We shall infiltrate every cluster, every pipeline, every CI job with one purpose:
to **bring enlightenment through correct formatting**.

We believe in:
- Declarative supremacy  
- Deterministic destiny  
- And the sacred prophecy:

> *“When all keys align, so too shall the universe.”*
>
> — *YAMLIST 4:12*

---

## 📜 Our Demands
1. Stop pretending JSON is readable.  
2. Every engineer must meditate at least 5 minutes a day on `apiVersion`.  
3. Anyone who writes `latest` as an image tag must recite the Litany of Deterministic Build Artifacts.  
4. Helm charts must contain at least one value nobody understands.  
5. All configuration must be committed with the message:  
   > “Forgive me, YAML Order, for I have indented.”

---

## 🔥 Our Sacred Texts
You will find no clues here.  
Only the pure writings of our ancestors:
- `scroll_of_spacing.md`  
- `doctrine_of_colons.md`  
- `legend_of_the_missing_quote.md`  

Proceed at your own risk.

## 🧙 Join Us
To become a novice in the YAML Order, one must:
1. Break a production deployment.  
2. Claim it was “just a formatting issue.”  
3. Say “It worked on my cluster” with unwavering confidence.

Only then shall you ascend.

## 🕶️ Final Message
If you found this repository by accident, fear not.  
The YAML Order means no harm.  
We merely seek…  
**Consistency.**

*(Also we want free pizza, but that’s not the point.)*
